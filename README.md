# Project 1 Anomaly Detection
## By Evan Delasota, Mathew Enochs, John Tarroza

### Anomaly detection is any process that finds the outliers of a dataset; those items that don't belong.

#### This program compares the results of two algorithms used to detect outliers and prints out the results in a list. The two algorithms used are *Tukey's Fences* and the 68-95-99.7 rule with *standard deviation*.
